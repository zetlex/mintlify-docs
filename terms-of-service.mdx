#### General Conditions with AffordableBytes
AffordableBytes reserves the right to modify the terms and pricing for hosting services at any time. The company ensures the servers are kept updated and maintains the required security within a 72-hour timeframe. Force majeure events are exempted. Compensation for downtime will be considered by AffordableBytes, but customers cannot make claims against AffordableBytes. AffordableBytes retains the right to relocate customers to a different IP and/or physical server. All hosting with AffordableBytes is subject to German law.


#### Dedicated Servers and Virtual Machines
A binding agreement is established between the customer and AffordableBytes for the duration of the lease period. After the selected period expires, the customer can choose to renew or let the agreement and product expire. The customer has 2 days to renew their product after the expiration date; otherwise, all content will be deleted. Abuse of AffordableBytes' network, including hacking and carrying out DDoS attacks, is strictly prohibited. Abuse results in immediate server closure with no possibility of a refund.


#### Prices and VAT
All prices are in EURO and include applicable Danish VAT at 25%.


#### Data Responsibility
The use of products from AffordableBytes is at the customer's own risk. AffordableBytes does not assume responsibility for data or content. This means that the customer is fully responsible for the data on their product, including any illegal or offensive material.


#### Payment and Conditions
Upon purchasing a product, an invoice is issued, and the price on the invoice is final. Customers have a 14-day withdrawal period, provided the product has not been used. A dedicated server is considered in use when the order is placed. It is the customer's responsibility to extend their products, and AffordableBytes is not responsible for data loss upon product expiration.


#### Violation of Terms
If a customer violates the applicable rules and laws, AffordableBytes will issue a warning via email, and repeated violations will result in the user being locked. AffordableBytes reserves the right to close an account if the violation is particularly severe, such as copyright infringement, which may lead to legal action. AffordableBytes will disclose customer information to the appropriate authorities. The account is locked immediately, and there is no compensation for the remaining product period.


#### Personal Data and Information
AffordableBytes is an independent hosting company that does not disclose information to third parties. All information remains confidential between AffordableBytes and the customer. According to data protection laws, customers have the right to full insight into the information stored by AffordableBytes. AffordableBytes retains all information for at least 5 years.


#### Data Loss
AffordableBytes cannot be held liable for data loss due to events such as power outages, system failures, force majeure, break-ins, or similar circumstances. If a technical intervention is necessary, AffordableBytes is not responsible for data loss.


#### Delivery
AffordableBytes sets up the server as quickly as possible, usually within a few minutes. For dedicated servers, the delivery time is longer, typically 1-7 business days. AffordableBytes reserves the right to postpone setup due to technical difficulties or payment issues.


#### Right of Withdrawal
By purchasing a product from AffordableBytes, the customer waives the 14-day withdrawal right once the products are in use. However, we offer a 48-hour refund policy with no questions asked, provided the request is made within 48 hours of purchase. Please note that refunds are not available via cryptocurrency. After the 48-hour period or if the product is in use, it is non-refundable, except in special cases where AffordableBytes is responsible for significant downtime in the customer's service.


#### Automatic Subscription Payment
Upon subscribing to automatic subscription payments, the server will be automatically renewed. To deactivate automatic payment, customers must do so through the payment method panel or notify AffordableBytes in writing via email or a support ticket before the server is renewed.
